# 2018-2019-Electrical-Documentation
This is our electrical documentation for the 2018-2019 season. This maps out all of the components, ports, and connections we utilized during the season. 
Over the course of the season, we made a plethora of changes an we couldn't exactly keep up with all the documentation according to what was on our robot. We ended up ditching both the cable diagrams and the cable sheets midesason to conserve time.  

The Component Port Map documents the input and outputs of the control system components. The wiring diagrams give a visual representation of the electrical system and how components are wired together. The cable sheets documents each individual connection and the connectors associated with them. The cable diagrams show a visual representation of each connection.

The diagrams/spreadsheets should correspond with eachother, but numerous discrepancies exist between them. The Component Port Map has the up-to-date information.
