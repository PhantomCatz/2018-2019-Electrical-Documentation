# 2018-2019-Electrical-Documentation
This is our electrical documentation for the 2018-2019 season. This maps out all of the components, ports, and connections we utilized during the season. 
Over the course of the season, we made a plethora of changes an we couldn't exactly keep up with all the documentation according to what was on our robot. We ended up ditching both the cable diagrams and the cable sheets midesason to conserve time.
